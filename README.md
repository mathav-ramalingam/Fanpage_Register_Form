I've created a dynamic and user-friendly registration form that ensures a smooth sign-up process for fans looking to join the club. From validating inputs like usernames, email addresses, and passwords to checking file uploads for images, the form is designed to provide a seamless experience.

Features include:
 -Real-time input validation for accuracy and completeness.
 -Custom error messages to guide users through the registration process.
 -Checkbox validation for terms and conditions agreement.
 -Support for file uploads for user photos.

Check out the form in action and let me know what you think!
